[Keshav S. How to read a paper. ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 2007, 37(3): 83-84.](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf)作为一个研究者，不论是为了了解领域的最新情况还是对新领域进行调查，都需要广泛地阅读论文。在最近的学习中，发现自己读论文的效率偏低，于是尝试改进一下自己阅读的方法。同时，待读论文之间的关系和论文分类太乱，于是开始尝试使用Zotero来管理读的一些论文。



# The Three-Pass Approach

## The first pass( quick scan, 5-10 minutes)

​	The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of the paper.	

1. This pass should take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps: **Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction** 
2. Read the **section and sub-section headings,** but ignore everything else 
3. Read the **conclusions**
4. Glance over the **references**, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read



​	At the end of the first pass, you should be able to **answer the five Cs:** 

1. Category: **What type of paper is this?** A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype? 
2. Context: **Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?** 
3. Correctness: **Do the assumptions appear to be valid?** 
4. Contributions: **What are the paper’s main contributions?** 
5. Clarity: **Is the paper well written?**



## The second pass(ignore details & make comments, 1 hour)

​	In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs. It helps to jot down the key points, or to make comments in the margins, as you read.

1. **Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper**. Pay special attention to **graphs**. Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant? **Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent**.
2. Remember to **mark relevant unread references for further reading** (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).



## The third pass( virtually re-implement)

​	**Making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work**.By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.

​	At the end of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points. In particular, you should be able to **pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.**
