Project
======
## [Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar): Optimizing Negative Acknowledgement Memory Usage
Contributed a memory-efficient redesign of the NegativeAcksTracker in Apache Pulsar C++ & Go Client, addressing
excessive memory usage and redelivery inaccuracies under high-throughput workloads (PR: [C++ Client](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-cpp/pull/497) & [Go Client](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-go/pull/1410)).
Replaced HashMap with a timestamp-bucketed structure, leveraging RoaringBitmap to compactly store entry IDs and reduce per-message
memory overhead.
